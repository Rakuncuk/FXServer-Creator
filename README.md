# FXServer Creator

Automatically downloads the artifact and resource files for a default FiveM server to a folder you specify

## Setup
1. Download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
3. Extract the files to a folder
4. Open up a command prompt and navigate to that folder
5. Type `npm i` and let it do its black magic thing
6. After the installation is done type `node main.js`
7. Follow the instructions and its done!

Packing this with [nexe](https://github.com/nexe/nexe) might be the best use case for this if you know what you are doing.
